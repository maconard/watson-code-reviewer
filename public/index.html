    <h2 title="Project Info">About Our Project </h2> 
    <p>
    As software developers, we wanted to create a tool that can analyze code and recommend areas of improvement in order to keep team members on a uniform style and writing readable code. It can be frustrating to approach a new code base and see different styles and hard-to-read formatting throughout a single project. These types of issues make it take longer to learn the project and to begin contributing on top of it. This project uses Watson Machine Learning to analyze your code for readability and provides an overall readability score as well as readability highlighting for each line. Go to the <a href="analysis.html">Watson Code Reviewer</a> page to try it out!
