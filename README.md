# Create and deploy a Node.js web application

> We have similar applications available for [Go](https://github.com/IBM/go-web-app), [Java Spring](https://github.com/IBM/spring-web-app), [Swift](https://github.com/IBM/swift-web-app), Python [Django](https://github.com/IBM/django-web-app) & [Flask](https://github.com/IBM/flask-web-app), and [Java Liberty](https://github.com/IBM/java-liberty-web-app).

In this sample application, you will create a web application using Express to serve web pages in Node.js, complete with standard best practices, including a health check and application metric monitoring.

This app contains an opinionated set of files for web serving:

- `public/index.html`
- `public/404.html`
- `public/500.html`


## Steps

You can [deploy this application to IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/developer/appservice/starter-kits/5c392271-75bf-38ab-9ba8-ea918f110fb0/nodejs-web-app-with-expressjs) or [build it locally](#building-locally) by cloning this repo first. Once your app is live, you can access the `/health` endpoint to build out your cloud native application.

### Deploying to IBM Cloud

    </a>
</p>

Use the button above to deploy this same application to IBM Cloud. This option will create a deployment pipeline, complete with a hosted Git lab project and DevOps toolchain. You will have the option of deploying to either Cloud Foundry or a Kubernetes cluster. [IBM Cloud DevOps](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/devops) services provides toolchains as a set of tool integrations that support development, deployment, and operations tasks inside IBM Cloud. 


### Building Locally

To get started building this application locally, you can either run the application natively or use the [IBM Cloud Developer Tools](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started) for containerization and easy deployment to IBM Cloud.

#### Native Application Development

- Install the latest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 6+ LTS version.

Once the Node toolchain has been installed, you can download the project dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

To run your application locally:

```bash
npm run start
```

Your application will be running at `http://localhost:3000`. You can access the `/health` and `/appmetrics-dash` endpoints at the host.

<!--#### IBM Cloud Developer Tools

Install [IBM Cloud Developer Tools](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started) on your machine by running the following command:
```
curl -sL https://ibm.biz/idt-installer | bash
```

Your application will be compiled with Docker containers. To compile and run your app, run:

```bash
ibmcloud dev build
ibmcloud dev run
```

This will launch your application locally. When you are ready to deploy to IBM Cloud on Cloud Foundry or Kubernetes, run one of the commands below:

```bash
ibmcloud dev deploy -t buildpack
ibmcloud dev deploy -t container
```

You can build and debug your app locally with:

```bash
ibmcloud dev build --debug
ibmcloud dev debug
```-->

##### Session Store

You may see this warning when running `ibmcloud dev run`:
```
Warning: connect.session() MemoryStore is not
designed for a production environment, as it will leak
memory, and will not scale past a single process.
```

When deploying to production, it is best practice to configure sessions to be stored in an external persistence service.
